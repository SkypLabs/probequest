Use Case
========

Let's consider the following simple scenario inspired from a real data
collection (the data have been anonymised): a device tries to connect to `John's
iPhone`, `CompanyX_staff`, `STARBUCKS-FREE-WIFI` and `VM21ECAB2`. Based on this
information, several assumptions can be made:

- The device owner's name is John.
- The device is set in English and its owner speaks this language (otherwise it
  would have been `iPhone de John` in French, `iPhone von John` in German, etc).
- The device should be a laptop trying to connect to an iPhone in hotspot mode.
  The owner has consequently at least two devices and is nomad.
- The owner works for CompanyX.
- The owner frequents coffee shops, in particular StarBucks.
- The owner is used to connecting to open Wi-Fi access points.
- `VM21ECAB2` seems to be a home access point and is the only one in the
  device's PNL. It is likely the owner's place and, consequently, the device's
  owner is a customer of Virgin Media.

As you can see, the amount of data inferred from these four probe requests is
already impressive, but we can go further. Relying on a database of Wi-Fi access
points’ location, such as `WIGLE.net`_, it becomes possible to determine the
places the device’s owner has previously been to. VM21ECAB2 should be a unique
name, easily localisable on a map. Same for CompanyX_staff. If this last one is
not unique (because CompanyX has several offices), crossing the data we have can
help us in our investigation. For example, if CompanyX is present in several
countries, we can assume that the device’s owner lives in a country where both
CompanyX and Virgin Media are present. Once we have determined which office it
is, we can suppose that the device’s owner is used to stopping in StarBucks
located on their way from home to their office.

Profiling a person is the first step to conduct a social engineering attack. The
more we know about our target, the better chance the attack has to succeed.
Also, because we know which Wi-Fi access points our target’s devices will try to
connect to, an evil twin attack is conceivable.
