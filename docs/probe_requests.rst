What are Wi-Fi probe requests?
==============================

Probe requests are sent by a station to elicit information about access points,
in particular to determine if an access point is present or not in the nearby
environment. Some devices (mostly smartphones and tablets) use these requests to
determine if one of the networks they have previously been connected to is in
range, leaking their preferred network list (PNL) and, therefore, your personal
information.

Below is a typical Wi-Fi authentication process between a mobile station (for
example, your smartphone) and an access point (AP):

.. seqdiag::

    seqdiag admin {
      default_fontsize = 14;
      edge_length = 260;

	  autonumber = True;

      "Mobile Station" -> "Access Point" [label = "Probe Request"];
      "Mobile Station" <-- "Access Point" [label = "Probe Response"];
      "Mobile Station" -> "Access Point" [label = "Authentication Request"];
      "Mobile Station" <-- "Access Point" [label = "Authentication Response"];
      "Mobile Station" -> "Access Point" [label = "Association Request"];
      "Mobile Station" <-- "Access Point" [label = "Association Response"];
    }

Step 1 is optional (and therefore, step 2) since the access points announce
their presence by broadcasting their name (ESSID) using `beacon frames`_.
Consequently, it is not necessary to rely on probe requests to get the list of
the access points available. It is a design choice that, although it speeds up
the discovery process, causes privacy and security issues.

ProbeQuest can be used to leverage this leak of information to conduct diverse
social engineering and network attacks.
