Mitigation
==========

As far as I know, there are two mitigation techniques:

- Don’t use probe requests at all. It is by far the most efficient way not to
  leak any piece of information. As said earlier, it is not necessary to rely on
  probe requests to get the list of the nearby access points since they
  broadcast their name by themselves.
- Randomise the source MAC address of each probe request sent. This way, it’s no
  longer possible for a third party to link probe requests to a specific device
  based on the Wi-Fi data collected. However, using a Software-Defined Radio to
  capture RF metadata such as the frequency offset, it would be possible to
  fingerprint each Wi-Fi packet and so each Wi-Fi device, regardless of their
  source MAC address (this technique will be implemented in ProbeQuest).

Android
-------

Some Android-based operating systems, like `GrapheneOS`_, randomise the source
MAC address natively. Otherwise, you can install `Wi-Fi Privacy Police`_ from
`F-Droid`_ or the `Play Store`_ to prevent your Android devices from leaking
their PNL.

Once installed, the **Privacy protection** option should be switched on.

iOS
---

On iOS, the source MAC address is randomised since iOS 8.
